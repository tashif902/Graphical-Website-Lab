    <h1>Spooky Movie Review</h1>
    
<p>
    Horror movies can actually be good for us in a few surprising ways. They give us a chance to face our fears in a safe way, which can help us feel braver in real life. When we watch scary scenes, our hearts race, and that adrenaline rush can be kind of fun! Plus, watching horror movies with friends can bring us closer together as we share the experience and laugh about the scares afterward. Overall, horror films are not just about being scared; they can also help us understand our feelings and connect with others.
